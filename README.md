# Customer-Segmentation
Project Overview
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using the KMeans clustering algorithm. By analyzing customer data from a mall, including age, annual income, and spending score, we identify distinct customer groups to inform targeted marketing strategies.

Customer segmentation helps businesses:
Understand customer behavior
Personalize marketing campaigns
Optimize product offerings
Increase customer satisfaction and sales

Libraries Used
- `pandas` – for data manipulation
- `numpy` – for numerical operations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – for data visualization
